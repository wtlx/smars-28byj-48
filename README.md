Trying to get the SMARS modular robot running with the 28byj-48 steppers

Get the 3D printed SMARS modular robot from Thingiverse.com: 
The original: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2662828
The one with the 28byj-48 steppers: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2778904

Due to some issues with the steppers and the arduino libraries, here is a playground for getting them (and the robot) running. 

Beware of bad code: This is an educational project!
